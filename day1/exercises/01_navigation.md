# Exercise 1 â€” Navigation

Goals: practice `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, absolute vs relative paths, and tab completion.

Tasks:
- Print your current directory.
- List files (all, including hidden) with details and human sizes.
- Change to the `day1/data` directory using a relative path from repo root.
- List only directories recursively under `day1/data`.
- Using absolute path, cd to `projects/alpha/logs` and back.

Hints:
- `pwd`, `ls -la`, `ls -lh`, `cd`, `ls -R`
- Use `cd -` to jump back.
