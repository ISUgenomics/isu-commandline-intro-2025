# Exercise 4 â€” Permissions and ownership

Goals: read permissions with `ls -l` and change with `chmod` (basics only)

Tasks:
- List long-format details for everything in `day1/work/step1`
- Make one file read-only for yourself
- Add execute permission to a script in `day1/scripts/`
- Remove execute permission from any copied log file

Hints:
- `ls -l`, `chmod u-w file`, `chmod +x script.sh`, `chmod -x file`
- If you need to restore, `chmod u+w file`
